# Build Your Own Text Editor

Welcome! This is an instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text
editor in C.

The text editor is [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108), with some
changes. It's about 1000 lines of C in a single file with no dependencies, and
it implements all the basic features you expect in a minimal editor, as well as
syntax highlighting and a search feature.

This booklet walks you through building the editor in **184 steps**. Each step,
you'll add, change, or remove a few lines of code. Most steps, you'll be able
to **observe the changes** you made by compiling and running the program
immediately afterwards.

I explain each step along the way, sometimes in a lot of detail. Feel free to
skim or skip the prose, as the main point of this is that **you are going to
build a text editor from scratch**! Anything you learn along the way is bonus,
and there's plenty to learn just from typing in the changes to the code and
observing the results.

See the [appendices](08.appendices.html) for more information on the tutorial
itself (including what to do if you get stuck, and where to get help).

If you're ready to begin, then go to [chapter 1](01.setup.html)!
