# Raw input and output

## Press <kbd>Ctrl-Q</kbd> to quit

Last chapter we saw that the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key combined with the alphabetic
keys seemed to map to bytes 1&ndash;26. We can use this to detect
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key combinations and map them to different operations in our
editor. We'll start by mapping <kbd>Ctrl-Q</kbd> to the quit operation.

{{ctrl-q}}

The `CTRL_KEY` macro bitwise-ANDs a character with the value `00011111`, in
binary. (In C, you generally specify bitmasks using hexadecimal, since C
doesn't have binary literals, and hexadecimal is more concise and readable once
you get used to it.) In other words, it sets the upper 3 bits of the character
to `0`. This mirrors what the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key does in the terminal: 
it strips bits 5 and 6 from whatever key you press in combination with
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, and sends that (By convention, bit numbering starts from 0). 
The ASCII character set seems to be designed this way on purpose. 
(It is also similarly designed so that you can set and clear bit 5 to switch 
between lowercase and uppercase.)


## Refactor keyboard input

Let's make a function for low-level keypress reading, and another function for
mapping keypresses to editor operations. We'll also stop printing out
keypresses at this point.

{{refactor-input}}

`editorReadKey()`'s job is to wait for one keypress, and return it. Later,
we'll expand this function to handle escape sequences, which involves reading
multiple bytes that represent a single keypress, as is the case with the arrow
keys.

`editorProcessKeypress()` waits for a keypress, and then handles it. Later, it
will map various <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key combinations and other special keys to
different editor functions, and insert any alphanumeric and other printable
keys' characters into the text that is being edited.

Note that `editorReadKey()` belongs in the `/*** terminal ***/` section because
it deals with low-level terminal input, whereas `editorProcessKeypress()`
belongs in the new `/*** input ***/` section because it deals with mapping keys
to editor functions at a much higher level.

Now we have vastly simplified `main()`, and we will try to keep it that way.

## Clear the screen

We're going to render the editor's user interface to the screen after each
keypress. Let's start by just clearing the screen.

{{clear-screen}}

`write()` and `STDOUT_FILENO` come from `<unistd.h>`.

The `4` in our `write()` call means we are writing `4` bytes out to the
terminal. The first byte is `\x1b`, which is the escape character, or `27` in
decimal. (Try and remember `\x1b`, we will be using it a lot.) The other three
bytes are `[2J`.

We are writing an *escape sequence* to the terminal. Escape sequences always
start with an escape character (`27`) followed by a `[` character. Escape
sequences instruct the terminal to do various text formatting tasks, such as
coloring text, moving the cursor around, and clearing parts of the screen.

We are using the `J` command
([Erase In Display](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#ED)) to clear
the screen. Escape sequence commands take arguments, which come before the
command. In this case the argument is `2`, which says to clear the entire
screen. `<esc>[1J` would clear the screen up to where the cursor is, and
`<esc>[0J` would clear the screen from the cursor up to the end of the screen.
Also, `0` is the default argument for `J`, so just `<esc>[J` by itself would
also clear the screen from the cursor to the end.

For our text editor, we will be mostly using
[VT100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100) escape sequences, which
are supported very widely by modern terminal emulators. See the
[VT100 User Guide](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html) for complete
documentation of each escape sequence.

If we wanted to support the maximum number of terminals out there, we could use
the [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses) library, which uses the
[terminfo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminfo) database to figure out the
capabilities of a terminal and what escape sequences to use for that particular
terminal.

## Reposition the cursor

You may notice that the `<esc>[2J` command left the cursor at the bottom of the
screen. Let's reposition it at the top-left corner so that we're ready to draw
the editor interface from top to bottom.

{{cursor-home}}

This escape sequence is only `3` bytes long, and uses the `H` command
([Cursor Position](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#CUP)) to
position the cursor. The `H` command actually takes two arguments: the row
number and the column number at which to position the cursor. So if you have an
80&times;24 size terminal and you want the cursor in the center of the screen, you could
use the command `<esc>[12;40H`. (Multiple arguments are separated by a `;`
character.) The default arguments for `H` both happen to be `1`, so we can
leave both arguments out and it will position the cursor at the first row and
first column, as if we had sent the `<esc>[1;1H` command. (Rows and columns are
numbered starting at `1`, not `0`.)

## Clear the screen on exit

Let's clear the screen and reposition the cursor when our program exits. If an
error occurs in the middle of rendering the screen, we don't want a bunch of
garbage left over on the screen, and we don't want the error to be printed
wherever the cursor happens to be at that point.

{{clean-exit}}

We have two exit points we want to clear the screen at: `die()`, and when the
user presses <kbd>Ctrl-Q</kbd> to quit.

We could use `atexit()` to clear the screen when our program exits, but then
the error message printed by `die()` would get erased right after printing it.

## Tildes

It's time to start drawing. Let's draw a column of tildes (`~`) on the left
hand side of the screen, like [vim](http://www.vim.org/) does. In our text
editor, we'll draw a tilde at the beginning of any lines that come after the
end of the file being edited.

{{tildes}}

`editorDrawRows()` will handle drawing each row of the buffer of text being
edited. For now it draws a tilde in each row, which means that row is not part
of the file and can't contain any text.

We don't know the size of the terminal yet, so we don't know how many rows to
draw. For now we just draw `24` rows.

After we're done drawing, we do another `<esc>[H` escape sequence to reposition
the cursor back up at the top-left corner.

## Global state

Our next goal is to get the size of the terminal, so we know how many rows to
draw in `editorDrawRows()`. But first, let's set up a global struct that will
contain our editor state, which we'll use to store the width and height of the
terminal. For now, let's just put our `orig_termios` global into the struct.

{{global-state}}

Our global variable containing our editor state is named `E`. We must replace
all occurrences of `orig_termios` with `E.orig_termios`.

## Window size, the easy way

On most systems, you should be able to get the size of the terminal by simply
calling `ioctl()` with the `TIOCGWINSZ` request. (As far as I can tell, it
stands for **T**erminal **IOC**tl (which itself stands for **I**nput/**O**utput
**C**on**t**ro**l**) **G**et **WIN**dow **S**i**Z**e.)

{{ioctl}}

`ioctl()`, `TIOCGWINSZ`, and `struct winsize` come from `<sys/ioctl.h>`.

On success, `ioctl()` will place the number of columns wide and the number of
rows high the terminal is into the given `winsize` struct. On failure,
`ioctl()` returns `-1`. We also check to make sure the values it gave back
weren't `0`, because apparently that's a possible erroneous outcome. If
`ioctl()` failed in either way, we have `getWindowSize()` report failure by
returning `-1`. If it succeeded, we pass the values back by setting the `int`
references that were passed to the function. (This is a common approach to
having functions return multiple values in C. It also allows you to use the
return value to indicate success or failure.)

Now let's add `screenrows` and `screencols` to our global editor state, and
call `getWindowSize()` to fill in those values.

{{init-editor}}

`initEditor()`'s job will be to initialize all the fields in the `E` struct.

Now we're ready to display the proper number of tildes on the screen:

{{screenrows}}

## Window size, the hard way

`ioctl()` isn't guaranteed to be able to request the window size on all
systems, so we are going to provide a fallback method of getting the window
size.

The strategy is to position the cursor at the bottom-right of the screen, then
use escape sequences that let us query the position of the cursor. That tells
us how many rows and columns there must be on the screen.

Let's start by moving the cursor to the bottom-right.

{{bottom-right}}

As you might have gathered from the code, there is no simple "move the cursor
to the bottom-right corner" command.

We are sending two escape sequences one after the other. The `C` command
([Cursor Forward](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#CUF)) moves the
cursor to the right, and the `B` command
([Cursor Down](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#CUD)) moves the
cursor down. The argument says how much to move it right or down by. We use a
very large value, `999`, which should ensure that the cursor reaches the right
and bottom edges of the screen.

The `C` and `B` commands are specifically
[documented](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#CUD) to stop the
cursor from going past the edge of the screen. The reason we don't use the
`<esc>[999;999H` command is that the
[documentation](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#CUP) doesn't
specify what happens when you try to move the cursor off-screen.

Note that we are sticking a `1 ||` at the front of our `if` condition
temporarily, so that we can test this fallback branch we are developing.

Because we're always returning `-1` (meaning an error occurred) from
`getWindowSize()` at this point, we make a call to `editorReadKey()` so we can
observe the results of our escape sequences before the program calls `die()`
and clears the screen. When you run the program, you should see the cursor is
positioned at the bottom-right corner of the screen, and then when you press a
key you'll see the error message printed by `die()` after it clears the screen.

Next we need to get the cursor position. The `n` command
([Device Status Report](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#DSR)) can
be used to query the terminal for status information. We want to give it an
argument of `6` to ask for the cursor position. Then we can read the reply from
the standard input. Let's print out each character from the standard input to
see what the reply looks like.

{{cursor-query}}

The reply is an escape sequence! It's an escape character (`27`), followed by a
`[` character, and then the actual response: `24;80R`, or similar. (This
escape sequence is documented as
[Cursor Position Report](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#CPR).)

As before, we've inserted a temporary call to `editorReadKey()` to let us
observe our debug output before the screen gets cleared on exit.

(Note: If you're using **Bash on Windows**, `read()` doesn't time out so you'll
be stuck in an infinite loop. You'll have to kill the process externally, or
exit and reopen the command prompt window.)

We're going to have to parse this response. But first, let's read it into a
buffer. We'll keep reading characters until we get to the `R` character.

{{response-buffer}}

When we print out the buffer, we don't want to print the `'\x1b'` character,
because the terminal would interpret it as an escape sequence and wouldn't
display it. So we skip the first character in `buf` by passing `&buf[1]` to
`printf()`. `printf()` expects strings to end with a `0` byte, so we make sure
to assign `'\0'` to the final byte of `buf`.

If you run the program, you'll see we have the response in `buf` in the form of
`<esc>[24;80`. Let's parse the two numbers out of there using `sscanf()`:

{{parse-response}}

`sscanf()` comes from `<stdio.h>`.

First we make sure it responded with an escape sequence. Then we pass a pointer
to the third character of `buf` to `sscanf()`, skipping the `'\x1b'` and `'['`
characters. So we are passing a string of the form `24;80` to `sscanf()`. We
are also passing it the string `%d;%d` which tells it to parse two integers
separated by a `;`, and put the values into the `rows` and `cols` variables.

Our fallback method for getting the window size is now complete. You should see
that `editorDrawRows()` prints the correct number of tildes for the height of
your terminal.

Now that we know that works, let's remove the `1 ||` we put in the `if`
condition temporarily.

{{back-to-ioctl}}

## The last line

Maybe you noticed the last line of the screen doesn't seem to have a tilde.
That's because of a small bug in our code. When we print the final tilde, we
then print a `"\r\n"` like on any other line, but this causes the terminal to
scroll in order to make room for a new, blank line. Let's make the last line an
exception when we print our `"\r\n"`'s.

{{last-line}}

## Append buffer

It's not a good idea to make a whole bunch of small `write()`'s every time we
refresh the screen. It would be better to do one big `write()`, to make sure
the whole screen updates at once. Otherwise there could be small
unpredictable pauses between `write()`'s, which would cause an annoying flicker
effect.

We want to replace all our `write()` calls with code that appends the string to
a buffer, and then `write()` this buffer out at the end. Unfortunately, C
doesn't have dynamic strings, so we'll create our own dynamic string type that
supports one operation: appending.

Let's start by making a new `/*** append buffer ***/` section, and defining the
`abuf` struct under it.

{{abuf-struct}}

An append buffer consists of a pointer to our buffer in memory, and a length.
We define an `ABUF_INIT` constant which represents an empty buffer. This acts
as a constructor for our `abuf` type.

Next, let's define the `abAppend()` operation, as well as the `abFree()`
destructor.

{{abuf-append}}

`realloc()` and `free()` come from `<stdlib.h>`. `memcpy()` comes from
`<string.h>`.

To append a string `s` to an `abuf`, the first thing we do is make sure we
allocate enough memory to hold the new string. We ask `realloc()` to give us a
block of memory that is the size of the current string plus the size of the
string we are appending. `realloc()` will either extend the size of the block
of memory we already have allocated, or it will take care of `free()`ing the
current block of memory and allocating a new block of memory somewhere else
that is big enough for our new string.

Then we use `memcpy()` to copy the string `s` after the end of the current data
in the buffer, and we update the pointer and length of the `abuf` to the new
values.

`abFree()` is a destructor that deallocates the dynamic memory used by an
`abuf`.

Okay, our `abuf` type is ready to be put to use.

{{use-abuf}}

In `editorRefreshScreen()`, we first initialize a new `abuf` called `ab`, by
assigning `ABUF_INIT` to it. We then replace each occurrence of
`write(STDOUT_FILENO, ...)` with `abAppend(&ab, ...)`. We also pass `ab` into
`editorDrawRows()`, so it too can use `abAppend()`. Lastly, we `write()` the
buffer's contents out to standard output, and free the memory used by the
`abuf`.

## Hide the cursor when repainting

There is another possible source of the annoying flicker effect we will take
care of now. It's possible that the cursor might be displayed in the middle of
the screen somewhere for a split second while the terminal is drawing to the
screen. To make sure that doesn't happen, let's hide the cursor before
refreshing the screen, and show it again immediately after the refresh
finishes.

{{hide-cursor}}

We use escape sequences to tell the terminal to hide and show the cursor. The
`h` and `l` commands
([Set Mode](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#SM),
[Reset Mode](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#RM)) are used to turn
on and turn off various terminal features or
["modes"](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#S3.3.4). The VT100 User
Guide just linked to doesn't document argument `?25` which we use above. It
appears the cursor hiding/showing feature appeared in
[later VT models](http://vt100.net/docs/vt510-rm/DECTCEM.html). So some
terminals might not support hiding/showing the cursor, but if they don't, then
they will just ignore those escape sequences, which isn't a big deal in this
case.

## Clear lines one at a time

Instead of clearing the entire screen before each refresh, it seems more
optimal to clear each line as we redraw them. Let's remove the `<esc>[2J`
(clear entire screen) escape sequence, and instead put a `<esc>[K` sequence at
the end of each line we draw.

{{clear-line}}

The `K` command
([Erase In Line](http://vt100.net/docs/vt100-ug/chapter3.html#EL)) erases part
of the current line. Its argument is analogous to the `J` command's argument:
`2` erases the whole line, `1` erases the part of the line to the left of the
cursor, and `0` erases the part of the line to the right of the cursor. `0` is
the default argument, and that's what we want, so we leave out the argument and
just use `<esc>[K`.

## Welcome message

Perhaps it's time to display a welcome message. Let's display the name of our
editor and a version number a third of the way down the screen.

{{welcome}}

`snprintf()` comes from `<stdio.h>`.

We use the `welcome` buffer and `snprintf()` to interpolate our `KILO_VERSION`
string into the welcome message. We also truncate the length of the string in
case the terminal is too tiny to fit our welcome message.

Now let's center it.

{{center}}

To center a string, you divide the screen width by `2`, and then subtract half
of the string's length from that. In other words:
`E.screencols/2 - welcomelen/2`, which simplifies to
`(E.screencols - welcomelen) / 2`. That tells you how far from the left edge of
the screen you should start printing the string. So we fill that space with
space characters, except for the first character, which should be a tilde.

## Move the cursor

Let's focus on input now. We want the user to be able to move the cursor
around. The first step is to keep track of the cursor's `x` and `y` position in
the global editor state.

{{cx-cy}}

`E.cx` is the horizontal coordinate of the cursor (the column) and `E.cy` is
the vertical coordinate (the row). We initialize both of them to `0`, as we
want the cursor to start at the top-left of the screen. (Since the C language
uses indexes that start from `0`, we will use 0-indexed values wherever
possible.)

Now let's add code to `editorRefreshScreen()` to move the cursor to the
position stored in `E.cx` and `E.cy`.

{{set-cursor-position}}

`strlen()` comes from `<string.h>`.

We changed the old `H` command into an `H` command with arguments, specifying
the exact position we want the cursor to move to. (Make sure you deleted the
old `H` command, as the above diff makes that easy to miss.)

We add `1` to `E.cy` and `E.cx` to convert from 0-indexed values to the
1-indexed values that the terminal uses.

At this point, you could try initializing `E.cx` to `10` or something, or
insert `E.cx++` into the main loop, to confirm that the code works as intended
so far.

Next, we'll allow the user to move the cursor using the
<kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> keys. (If you're unfamiliar
with using these keys as arrow keys: <kbd>w</kbd> is your up arrow,
<kbd>s</kbd> is your down arrow, <kbd>a</kbd> is left, <kbd>d</kbd> is right.)

{{move-cursor}}

Now you should be able to move the cursor around with those keys.

## Arrow keys

Now that we have a way of mapping keypresses to move the cursor, let's replace
the <kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> keys with the arrow keys.
Last chapter we [saw](02.enteringRawMode.html#display-keypresses) that pressing
an arrow key sends multiple bytes as input to our program. These bytes are in
the form of an escape sequence that starts with `'\x1b'`, `'['`, followed by an
`'A'`, `'B'`, `'C'`, or `'D'` depending on which of the four arrow keys was
pressed. Let's modify `editorReadKey()` to read escape sequences of this form
as a single keypress.

{{detect-arrow-keys}}

If we read an escape character, we immediately read two more bytes into the
`seq` buffer. If either of these reads time out (after 0.1 seconds), then we
assume the user just pressed the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key and return that.
Otherwise we look to see if the escape sequence is an arrow key escape
sequence. If it is, we just return the corresponding
<kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> character, for now. If it's
not an escape sequence we recognize, we just return the escape character.

We make the `seq` buffer 3 bytes long because we will be handling longer escape
sequences in the future.

We have basically aliased the arrow keys to the
<kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> keys. This gets the arrow keys
working immediately, but leaves the
<kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> keys still mapped to the
`editorMoveCursor()` function. What we want is for `editorReadKey()` to return
special values for each arrow key that let us identify that a particular arrow
key was pressed.

Let's start by replacing each instance of the
<kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd> characters with the constants
`ARROW_UP`, `ARROW_LEFT`, `ARROW_DOWN`, and `ARROW_RIGHT`.

{{arrow-keys-enum}}

Now we just have to choose a representation for arrow keys that doesn't
conflict with <kbd>w</kbd><kbd>a</kbd><kbd>s</kbd><kbd>d</kbd>, in the
`editorKey` enum. We will give them a large integer value that is out of the
range of a `char`, so that they don't conflict with any ordinary keypresses. We
will also have to change all variables that store keypresses to be of type
`int` instead of `char`.

{{arrow-keys-int}}

By setting the first constant in the enum to `1000`, the rest of the constants
get incrementing values of `1001`, `1002`, `1003`, and so on.

That concludes our arrow key handling code. At this point, it can be fun to try
entering an escape sequence manually while the program runs. Try pressing the
<kbd>Escape</kbd> key, the <kbd>[</kbd> key, and <kbd>Shift+C</kbd>
in sequence really fast, and you may
see your keypresses being interpreted as the right arrow key being pressed. You
have to be pretty fast to do it, so you may want to adjust the `VTIME` value
in `enableRawMode()` temporarily, to make it easier. (It also helps to know
that pressing <kbd>Ctrl-[</kbd> is the same as pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd>
key, for the same reason that <kbd>Ctrl-M</kbd> is the same as pressing
<kbd>Enter</kbd>: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> clears the 6th and 7th bits of the character
you type in combination with it.)

## Prevent moving the cursor off screen

Currently, you can cause the `E.cx` and `E.cy` values to go into the negatives,
or go past the right and bottom edges of the screen. Let's prevent that by
doing some bounds checking in `editorMoveCursor()`.

{{off-screen}}

## The <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> keys

To complete our low-level terminal code, we need to detect a few more special
keypresses that use escape sequences, like the arrow keys did. We'll start with
the <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> keys. <kbd>Page Up</kbd> is
sent as `<esc>[5~` and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> is sent as `<esc>[6~`.

{{detect-page-up-down}}

Now you see why we declared `seq` to be able to store 3 bytes. If the byte
after `[` is a digit, we read another byte expecting it to be a `~`. Then we
test the digit byte to see if it's a `5` or a `6`.

Let's make <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> do something. For now,
we'll have them move the cursor to the top of the screen or the bottom of the
screen.

{{page-up-down-simple}}

We create a code block with that pair of braces so that we're allowed to
declare the `times` variable. (You can't declare variables directly inside a
`switch` statement.) We simulate the user pressing the <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or
<kbd>&darr;</kbd> keys enough times to move to the top or bottom of the screen.
Implementing <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> in this way will make
it a lot easier for us later, when we implement scrolling.

If you're on a laptop with an <kbd>Fn</kbd> key, you may be able to press
<kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&uarr;</kbd> and <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&darr;</kbd> to simulate
pressing the <kbd>Page Up</kbd> and <kbd>Page Down</kbd> keys.

## The <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys

Now let's implement the <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys. Like the
previous keys, these keys also send escape sequences. Unlike the previous keys,
there are many different escape sequences that could be sent by these keys,
depending on your OS, or your terminal emulator. The <kbd>Home</kbd> key could
be sent as `<esc>[1~`, `<esc>[7~`, `<esc>[H`, or `<esc>OH`. Similarly, the
<kbd>End</kbd> key could be sent as `<esc>[4~`, `<esc>[8~`, `<esc>[F`, or
`<esc>OF`. Let's handle all of these cases.

{{detect-home-end}}

Now let's make <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> do something. For now, we'll
have them move the cursor to the left or right edges of the screen.

{{home-end-simple}}

If you're on a laptop with an <kbd>Fn</kbd> key, you may be able to press
<kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd> and <kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> to simulate
pressing the <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> keys.

## The <kbd>Delete</kbd> key

Lastly, let's detect when the <kbd>Delete</kbd> key is pressed. It simply sends
the escape sequence `<esc>[3~`, so it's easy to add to our switch statement. We
won't make this key do anything for now.

{{detect-delete-key}}

If you're on a laptop with an <kbd>Fn</kbd> key, you may be able to press
<kbd>Fn</kbd>+<kbd>Backspace</kbd> to simulate pressing the <kbd>Delete</kbd>
key.

In the [next chapter](04.aTextViewer.html), we will get our program to display
text files, complete with vertical and horizontal scrolling and a status bar.
